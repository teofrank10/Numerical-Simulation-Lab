Repository of solved exercises from the Numerical Simulation Laboratory, held by [Prof. Davide E. Galli](http://materia.fisica.unimi.it/~dgalli/) at Univerist√† degli Studi di Milano.


The work is presented and commented using jupiter notebooks.  
In order to solve the exercises, except for exercises 11 and 12) I used C++ and you will find the code in the sub-folder /src of each folder.  
Each folder has a Makefile and the executables are always called using the name of the relative source file, e.g. ex1.2 is the executable obtained from ex1.2.cpp.  
Where necessary, there are input files.  
In each folder there is a sub-folder /data, in which there are all the data obtained running the executable.  
For more complex exercises I used some classes; all the code relative to them (header files, source files, Makefile) are stored in a sub-folder called with the same name as the class.  
Finally, in all the exercises we use the random number generator, so I decided to store its code in a folder accessible from all exercise folders.
